# Digital-Clock-with-Alarm-
The Digital Clock with Alarm is a Python-Tkinter project that displays the current time and allows users to set an alarm in HH:MM:SS format. When the alarm time matches the system time, a notification appears, and a voice alert is played. It features a simple GUI with a clock, alarm display, and buttons to set or quit the alarm.
